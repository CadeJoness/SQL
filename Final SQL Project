I was given a "Final SQL Project" to JOIN everything I have learned about writing SQL.


-- #1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT FirstName, Customerid, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

-- #2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, Customerid, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country='Brazil';

-- #3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.Invoiceid, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers AS cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv
ON cust.Customerid=inv.Customerid
WHERE inv.BillingCountry='Brazil';

-- #4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title='Sales Support Agent';

-- #5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

-- #6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.Invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON cust.SupportRepId=emp.Employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices as inv ON inv.Customerid=cust.Customerid;

-- #7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.Total, cust.Country, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
FROM chinook.customers AS cust
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON cust.Customerid=inv.Customerid
JOIN chinook.employees AS emp ON emp.Employeeid=cust.SupportRepid;

-- #8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(Invoiceid)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-- #9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-- #10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tracks.Name, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks AS tracks
JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS inv
ON tracks.Trackid=inv.Trackid
ORDER BY inv.InvoiceLineId asc;

-- #11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tracks.Name AS TrackName, inv.InvoiceLineId, art.Name AS ArtistName
FROM chinook.tracks AS tracks
JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS inv ON tracks.TrackId=inv.TrackId
JOIN chinook.albums AS alb ON tracks.AlbumId=alb.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.artists AS art ON alb.ArtistId=art.ArtistId;

-- #12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS TrackName, a.Title AS AlbumName, m.Name AS MediaType, g.Name AS Genre
FROM chinook.tracks AS t
JOIN chinook.albums AS a ON t.AlbumId=a.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types AS m ON t.MediaTypeId=m.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres AS g ON t.GenreId=g.GenreId;

-- #13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepId
WHERE emp.Title='Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

-- #14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepId
WHERE emp.Title='Sales Support Agent'
AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC LIMIT 1;

-- #15. Which sales agent made the most dollar in sales excluding 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepId
WHERE emp.Title='Sales Support Agent'
AND inv.InvoiceDate NOT LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC LIMIT 1;

-- #16. How many total invoices are there from 2010?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId) AS 'Total Invoices' FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoices.InvoiceDate LIKE '2010%';
